Shininess
=========

A WordPress theme with a review system built in.

Shininess is a wide three-column theme. At present it is unfinished and severely lacking in color. When complete, it will contain options for several color and image variations. Media queries to adjust output for smaller screen sizes will be added when all templates are finalized. 

I'm not much of a programmer, so functions.php is largely gpl code modified for use with the theme. I've tried to include credits to the appropriate authors where their code is used, though I've since lost the source of some of my snippets. I will try to research and credit them properly in the future.

Rather than implement a cludgy custom-field setup for ratings, I've attempted to update the excellent Star Ratings for Reviews plugin as a built-in feature. Currently only its single-post features have been extensively tested.
